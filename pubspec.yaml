  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true
  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/pet-planet.png
    - assets/images/pet.png
    - assets/images/auth-background.png
    - assets/icons/plus.png
    - assets/svgs/order-success.svg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Cairo
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo_Black_900.ttf
          weight: 900
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo_Bold_700.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo_SemiBold_600.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo_Regular_400.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo_Light_300.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo_ExtraLight_275.ttf
          weight: 200
    - family: IconlyBroken
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/icons.ttf
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
